                <p>Current practices of performing road inspections
                    are time-consuming and labour-intensive. Road
                    surfaces degrade on a daily basis as a result of the
                    heavy traffic on them. This will not only impact the
                    driverâ€™s comfort but will also impact economic
                    efficiency. To maintain roads as efficiently as
                    possible, municipalities perform regular
                    inspections.

                <p>The aim of the project is to use machine learning
                    to study and analyze different types of road
                    defects and to automatically detect any road
                    abnormalities. We will design, build and test an
                    inspection system for this purpose.</p>

                <h3>How we
                    approached it
                </h3>
                <hr class="hr " />
                <p>The system is equipped with a camera to collect
                    video streams from different roads with and
                    without defects. Then, the captured data will be
                    analyzed using the Matlab machine learning
                    toolbox to train and test the network. Finally, the
                    system will provide recommended actions for the
                    municipality related to actions required to
                    fix/correct road defects. The approach is divided
                    into 4 main tasks: Data acquisition, Data
                    Training/Testing, and Dashboard Building and
                    Testing.

                <h3>Technology and resources used</h3>
                <hr class="hr " />
                <p>Our road inspection system utilizes advanced
                technology to automate the detection of road defects
                and damages. Equipped with HD cameras, the system
                captures live video streams from roads, allowing for
                comprehensive data acquisition. The captured data is
                then analyzed using the Matlab machine learning
                toolbox, enabling the training and testing of a network
                that can accurately categorize road flaws. By leveraging
                machine learning algorithms and image processing
                techniques, the system can detect various road defects,
                including cracks, patching, rutting, and deformation. It
                further enhances efficiency by providing recommended
                actions for municipalities to address and correct the
                identified road issues. Additionally, the system
                incorporates a user-friendly dashboard and graphical
                interface to visualize and report the detected road
                defects in real-time. This project showcases the power
                of technology in streamlining road inspections and
                improving infrastructure maintenance practices.</p>

                    <hr class="hr " />
                    <p>Our road inspection system will deliver
                        remarkable outcomes, bringing about positive
                        changes for infrastructure maintenance. By
                        harnessing cutting-edge technology, such as HD
                        cameras and machine learning algorithms, we
                        will automate the detection of road defects and
                        damages. This automation will significantly
                        reduce inspection time and effort, leading to
                        enhanced efficiency and resource allocation.
                        Through comprehensive data acquisition and
                        analysis, our system will accurately categorize
                        road flaws, providing municipalities with
                        actionable insights and recommended actions to
                        address and correct these issues promptly. The
                        real-time visualization capabilities offered by our
                        user-friendly dashboard will empower decisionmakers to prioritize and allocate resources
                        effectively. Ultimately, our road inspection system
                        will ensure safer and better-maintained roads,
                        contributing to improved transportation
                        infrastructure and the overall well-being of
                        communities.</p>
